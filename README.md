## **Description**
This is a set of five console games that was built on the bases of popular mobile brain training apps. Each game asks questions that need to be answered. After three correct answers, the game is considered to be completed.

## **Installation**
Run the following command in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/FoggySmile/python-project-49.git
cd python-project-49
make build
make package-install
```

## **Run games**
After installation, you can play games with the following commands:

  * ```brain-even``` - determine if the number is even
  * ```brain-calc``` - determine the result of a mathematical expression
  * ```brain-gcd``` - determine [the greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of two numbers
  * ```brain-progression``` - determine missing number in [arithmetic progression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression)
  * ```brain-prime``` - determine if the number is [prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_numbers)
